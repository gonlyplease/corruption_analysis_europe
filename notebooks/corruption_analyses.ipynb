    "2. Are there different forms of corruption prevalent in different European countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "While interesting, it may be challenging to obtain granular, comparable data across countries.\n",
    "Requires deep qualitative insights, which may not be fully captured by available datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What characteristics of a country predict the level of corruption?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's promising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows for quantitative analysis using regression or classification models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why it's promising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Focuses on change over time, enabling trend analysis.\n",
    "Useful for policy evaluation and forecasting.\n",
    "Encourages a deeper exploration of temporal datasets (e.g., economic reforms, governance improvements, etc.).\n",
    "Can help identify early warning signs for rising corruption.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is the PPP value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year, divided by the mid-year population.\n",
    "- **Range**: Measured in international dollars, adjusted for cost of living.\n",
    "- **Note**: Helps compare living standards across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), net inflows (% of GDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest in an enterprise operating in another economy.\n",
    "- **Range**: Expressed as a percentage of GDP.\n",
    "- **Note**: Includes equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and short/long-term capital.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors, and is divided by GDP.\n",
    "Source: International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics and Balance of Payments databases, World Bank, International Debt Statistics, and World Bank and OECD GDP estimates.\n",

    "#### Unemployment Rate (% of total labor force)\n",

    "- **Definition**: Refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.\n",

    "- **Note**: Definitions of labor force and unemployment differ by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gini Index\n",

    "- **Long definition**: Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.

    "Adding data from the World Happiness Report (WHR) to our corruption analysis gives us a fresh perspective that goes beyond just looking at economic and governance factors. While datasets like the World Bankâ€™s Control of Corruption Index (CCI) and the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) mainly focus on how institutions handle corruption, the WHR brings in social and well-being aspects. This helps us get a more complete picture of how corruption affects people's daily lives and what social factors might be linked to it. Looking at things like happiness, social support, and life satisfaction can give us valuable insights into the broader impacts of corruption and how it might be tackled more effectively."
