    "## Our 4 Starting Question we decided to change to a single one:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How well can the level of corruption in a European country be quantified?\n",
    "\n",
    "This questions is too broad and may lack specificity. Also not a good question to answer within a notebook.\n",
    "The definition of \"quantified\" needs clarificationâ€”are we looking at an index, a model, or a metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there different forms of corruption prevalent in different European countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "While interesting, it may be challenging to obtain granular, comparable data across countries.\n",
    "Requires deep qualitative insights, which may not be fully captured by available datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What characteristics of a country predict the level of corruption?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's promising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows for quantitative analysis using regression or classification models.\n",
    "Can leverage socio-economic, political, and governance indicators.\n",
    "Provides actionable insights for policymakers and organizations.\n",
    "Well-defined and measurable through publicly available datasets.\n",
    "Potential Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring data quality and avoiding biases in reporting.\n",
    "Distinguishing correlation from causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What characteristics of a country predict an increase or decrease in the level of corruption?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it's promising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Focuses on change over time, enabling trend analysis.\n",
    "Useful for policy evaluation and forecasting.\n",
    "Encourages a deeper exploration of temporal datasets (e.g., economic reforms, governance improvements, etc.).\n",
    "Can help identify early warning signs for rising corruption.\n",
    "Potential Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires time-series data and careful handling of lag effects.\n",
    "External factors (global economic crises, political events) may introduce noise.\n"
