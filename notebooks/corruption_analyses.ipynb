    "\n",
    "#### GDP per Capita (PPP - Purchasing Power Parity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is the PPP value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year, divided by the mid-year population.\n",
    "- **Range**: Measured in international dollars, adjusted for cost of living.\n",
    "- **Note**: Helps compare living standards across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), net inflows (% of GDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest in an enterprise operating in another economy.\n",
    "- **Range**: Expressed as a percentage of GDP.\n",
    "- **Note**: Includes equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and short/long-term capital.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors, and is divided by GDP.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Unemployment Rate (% of total labor force)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.\n",
    "- **Range**: Expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "- **Note**: Definitions of labor force and unemployment differ by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gini Index\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.\n",
    "- **Range**: 0 represents perfect equality; 100 implies perfect inequality.\n",
    "- **Note**: A higher Gini index indicates greater inequality.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule of Law\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Captures perceptions of confidence in the legal system, contract enforcement, and likelihood of crime and violence.\n",
    "- **Range**: -2.5 to 2.5.\n",
    "- **Note**: Higher values indicate stronger rule of law perceptions.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Rule of Law captures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control of Corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures perceptions of how public power is exercised for private gain.\n",
    "- **Range**: -2.5 to 2.5.\n",
    "- **Note**: Higher values indicate better control of corruption.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Control of Corruption captures perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as \"capture\" of the state by elites and private interests. Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Government Effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures perceptions of the quality of public services and policy implementation.\n",
    "- **Range**: -2.5 to 2.5.\n",
    "- **Note**: Higher values indicate more effective governance.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Government Effectiveness captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.\n",
    "Estimate gives the country's score on the aggregate indicator, in units of a standard normal distribution, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Estimate\n",
    "- **Definition**: Violence/Terrorism measures perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-motivated violence, including terrorism.\n",
    "- **Range**: -2.5 to 2.5. in units of a standard normal distribution,\n",
    "- **Note**: Higher values indicate more effective governance."

    "Adding data from the World Happiness Report (WHR) to our corruption analysis gives us a fresh perspective that goes beyond just looking at economic and governance factors. While datasets like the World Bank’s Control of Corruption Index (CCI) and the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) mainly focus on how institutions handle corruption, the WHR brings in social and well-being aspects. This helps us get a more complete picture of how corruption affects people's daily lives and what social factors might be linked to it. Looking at things like happiness, social support, and life satisfaction can give us valuable insights into the broader impacts of corruption and how it might be tackled more effectively."

    "## Why We’re Using (and Questioning) the UNODC Corruption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We're considering the **UNODC corruption and economic crime dataset** because it provides **actual reported cases**, unlike Transparency International’s CPI, which is based on perceptions. It covers specific corruption types like **bribery, fraud, and money laundering**, giving us more detailed insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "- **Objective Data:** Unlike CPI, it's based on real reported cases, not just opinions.\n",
    "- **Comparability:** Standardized as \"per 100,000 population,\" making cross-country comparisons easier.\n",
    "- **Detailed Breakdown:** Focus on different types of corruption, which helps with targeted analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- **Underreporting Issues:** Many corruption cases likely go unreported, making data reliability questionable.\n",
    "- **Legal Differences:** Definitions and enforcement levels vary across countries, affecting consistency.\n",
    "- **False Comparisons:** Lower numbers don’t always mean less corruption – it could just mean weaker enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "It’s useful, but with limitations. We'll need to look further to get a full picture\n"
