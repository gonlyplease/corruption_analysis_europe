    "- **Definition**: GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is the PPP value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year, divided by the mid-year population.\n",
    "- **Range**: Measured in international dollars, adjusted for cost of living.\n",
    "- **Note**: Helps compare living standards across countries.\n",

    "#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), net inflows (% of GDP)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest in an enterprise operating in another economy.\n",
    "- **Range**: Expressed as a percentage of GDP.\n",
    "- **Note**: Includes equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and short/long-term capital.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors, and is divided by GDP.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.\n",
    "- **Range**: 0 represents perfect equality; 100 implies perfect inequality.\n",
    "- **Note**: A higher Gini index indicates greater inequality.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line.\n",

    "- **Note**: Higher values indicate stronger rule of law perceptions.\n",
    "- **Long definition**: Rule of Law captures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence.

    "Adding data from the World Happiness Report (WHR) to our corruption analysis gives us a fresh perspective that goes beyond just looking at economic and governance factors. While datasets like the World Bank’s Control of Corruption Index (CCI) and the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) mainly focus on how institutions handle corruption, the WHR brings in social and well-being aspects. This helps us get a more complete picture of how corruption affects people's daily lives and what social factors might be linked to it. Looking at things like happiness, social support, and life satisfaction can give us valuable insights into the broader impacts of corruption and how it might be tackled more effectively."
