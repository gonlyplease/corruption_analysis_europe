## Already Done

* Preprocessing CPI Dataset
* Preprocessing Happiness Dataset
* Preprocessing GDP


### Interesting Numbers to look into:
- **Unemployment raste**:
- **FDI**: Foreign direct investment , could be very interesting
- Education level / Literacy rate: Well-educated populations may be more aware of rights and better able to hold officials accountable.
- Inequality (Gini coefficient): High levels of inequality can be associated with higher corruption because elites may capture wealth and political power.
- Urbanization rate: In some contexts, higher urbanization (and thus better infrastructure, media presence) can reduce corruption, though not always.

## Next steps

- Find more indicators like the ones lsited above
- Analyse certain indicators/datasets individually
- Decide on which dfs to combine
- Decide on methods, graphs, metrics which we eant to use to explore dependencies and isnights in eruopean corruption developements
