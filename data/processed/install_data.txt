**install_data.txt (Short Version)**

1. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   project/
   ├── notebooks/
   │   └── your_notebook.ipynb
   ├── data/
   │   ├── raw/
   │   └── processed/
   └── install_data.txt
   ```

2. **Files Needed**  
   - `../data/raw/world_happiness_report.xls`  
   - `../data/processed/europe_countries.csv`  
   - `../data/processed/CPI.csv`  
   - `../data/processed/world_bank_final.csv`  
   - `../data/processed/happiness_final.csv`  
   - `../data/processed/cpi_final.csv`  

3. **Instructions**  
   - **If a file is included in the ZIP**, place it in the matching subfolder shown above.  
   - **If a file is too large or missing**, download it from its source and put it in the same subfolder name (e.g., `data/raw/` or `data/processed/`).  
   - Ensure filenames match exactly what the notebook code expects.

That’s it! Once the files are in the right folders, open the Jupyter notebook and run it without errors.
